XRPL ScalableC is a competency ledger on a private blockchain network of universities and open source orgs for awarding badges and certificates to students can remain decentralized in the private blockchain network of schools and will always be one source of truth for authenticity.

The frontend application is an online platform to share ideas, develop project blueprints and design, and organize information and content through videos, audio, images and blogs for individuals, non-profit organizations and government agencies. We are developing an XRPL developer library and spreadsheet engine to enable secure data storage, transparent data movement and data authenticity: The model is based on the three ‘C’s of “collaboration, which is about working together at one place; community, when people work together, they form communities; and cooperation, which is the essential for any particular project.

Users can upload, watch and share videos, images, audios; create blogs; develop project blueprints and design, and start an online group or community—all at one platform as an individual or as an organization. The content has a decentralized ratings and review system.
